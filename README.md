## Project Title
Personality Type Checker

## What and Why
With the rise of social media, sharing personality test results has become "trendy". People want to share 
not only what they look like, what they wear, and which friends they have, but also what kind of people they are. 
However, traditional and well-known personality tests such as Myers-Briggs and Enneagrams are often too long to take 
and too difficult to understand for a lighthearted post on social media. So, I am planning to create a simplified 
personality test that is easy enough to take and cute enough to share. Also, this app will have social media features
where you can add friends, text friends, and share your results.

## For Whom?
This test is mainly aimed towards a younger audience(Gen Z and millenials) that are active on social media. 
However, it could be used in any age groups for people that want to find a fun and lighthearted way to introduce 
themselves and break the ice when meeting someone new.

## How?
The user will log in and answer a questionnaire about what they would do in certain situations. Then, they will receive their results explained and laid out in one page(to fit a mobile screen). After they finish taking the test, they are able to add 
friends on their account, text their friends, and share their results.

## Scope
UX/UI Designer: This person will do user research on what kind of personality features users associate themselves with and 
are willing to share on social media. Then, they will develop a set of questions for the personality test using what they 
found on their research. They will also keep gathering user feedback to check if users find their results from the personality 
test to be accurately describing them. Also, they will design the user flow of the app.
Back End Developer: The back end developer will create a program regarding the app's functionality, such as maintaining a database to keep user results, keeping user scores and combining them to conclude results, and so on.
Front End Developer: The front-end developer will create the web-page/mobile app where users can log in, take their tests, and share their results.
Graphic Designer: The graphic designer will design characters for each personality type to make the personality test results more appealing to share on social media.
